        <h1>Passing and returning function parameters.</h1>
        <p>The parameters are variables bound to the function</p>
		<p>Any variable used within the function is bound to that function</p>
		<p>If a variable is then returned from the function, it is no longer bound to that function but is now considered free</p>
		<p>Basically a variable will change from a state of bound or free during runtime</p>
		<p>A global function is free, but during runtime if used within a function it becomes bound to that function at that moment</p>
		
		<script>
			var i = 1; //global var, currently free
			function func1(){ 
				var result = func2(i); //result var is bound to this function. The i var which was free, is now bound to this function as it is used in this function
				alert("The value returned is: " +result); //result returned from func2(), x was freed from func2, but now is no longer free as it is assigned to bound var result, which means x is now bound.
			}
			function func2(x){ //x is bound to this function. Have passed it a global var, which started out as free but now is bound to this function
				x = x * 2; // x is bound to this function
				return x; // x is freed from this function, so no longer bound to it.
